PostScript Parser to JavaScript, written in Python.
=======

The latest version of the parser will be located in myscripts, the ps files are test files. 
The html files are the raw output of the python program, assuming you have your lib path set up
correctly this should output some pretty cool vector art.

Thats all for now.
